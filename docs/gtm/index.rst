I wrote this manual when I had my first contact with |cogent| and wanted to get a clear view of its syntax and its concepts.
For me the best way to do so is by writing it down in an organized way. Since I found that there was no similar documentation,
I decided to do so in a form that it may be usable (and hopefully useful) for others as well.

Zilin Chen has read the manual very carefully and has pointed me to many issues, so I was able to correct and improve it 
extensively. Many thanks to him for his commitment.

This manual is not intended as a tutorial for programming in |cogent| or to prove properties of |cogent| programs. The examples
are not chosen to be realistic, they are only used for illustrating the syntax. The manual only describes the |cogent|
"surface syntax" which is the interface for the programmer. Note that most publications about |cogent| refer to the more
concise "core syntax" which is created from the surface syntax by applying the "desugaring rules".

########################################################################

This part of the manual is not intended as
a tutorial for programming in |cogent|,
or to introduce proving properties of |cogent| programs.
The examples are not chosen to be realistic;
they are only used for illustrating the syntax.
Much of the manual describes the |cogent| "surface syntax",
which is the interface for the programmer;
most formal publications about |cogent|
refer to the more concise "core syntax",
which is created from the surface syntax
by applying the "desugaring rules".

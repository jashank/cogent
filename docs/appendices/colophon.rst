About Cogent
====================================

Cogent is still growing and changing fairly rapidly,
and this documentation might not cover everything.

For more advanced usage, or for experimental features,
you may find more success reading through the `Github issues`_.

You're also welcome to join our Slack workspace:
while it's currently by invitation only,
if you reach out any of our members,
we'll be happy to send you an invite.

.. _GitHub issues: https://github.com/NICTA/cogent/issues

If you want to get involved in Cogent development,
we highly recommend you get in touch first.
We try to list all planned or ongoing activities `on Github`_,
but for various reasons, not all are listed there.
Some of the `open issues`_,
especially those labelled ``newcomer``,
are relatively straightforward
and can serve as a great introduction to the codebase.

About This Documentation
====================================

This documentation is written in reStructuredText,
and is (presently) hosted on `Read The Docs`_
at <https://cogent.readthedocs.io/>.
The source files for the documentation
are in the Cogent repository,
in the ``docs`` directory.

To build the documentation locally,
you'll need Python's Sphinx_ documentation tools,
which is available in all good package managers;
and with that available, in the documentation directory,
you can run ``make`` to get a list of targets.

Producing PDFs of the documentation needs
an up-to-date TeX installation:
we suggest `TeX Live`_.
